## 3.1.0 (2017-4-23)

- Removed broken install script
- Updated documentation to detail serial woes on the RPi

## 3.0.5 (2017-1-22)

- Publishing a new version to update the README on npmjs.com. No other changes.

## 3.0.4 (2017-1-22)

- Added an explicit call to `this.destroy` in `process.on('beforeExit')`. This explicitly forces the serial port to close on exit.

## 3.0.3 (2016-12-30)

- Fixed a crash when a callback is not supplied to open or close

## 3.0.2 (2016-12-30)

- Added some important documentation to the README that needs to be on npmjs.com
  - Note: there are no code changes, only documentation

## 3.0.1 (2016-12-21)

- Added missing TypeScript definition package.json entry

## 3.0.0 (2016-12-21)

- Converted the project to TypeScript and cleaned up a bunch of odds and ends
- Updated the documentation, it was all kinds of wrong. My apologies.
  - BREAKING CHANGE (depending on your definition of it): the old documentation has a number of innacuracies. Technically the code behaves the same as in v2.0.0, but it behaves differently than the old documentation.

## 2.0.0 (2016-10-27)

- Upgraded serialport to version 4
    - POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE: the callback to raspi-serial's `write` method is directly passed to serialport's `write` method, which changed behavior in version 4. See [serialport's upgrade guide](https://github.com/EmergingTechnologyAdvisors/node-serialport/blob/master/UPGRADE_GUIDE.md) for more info
